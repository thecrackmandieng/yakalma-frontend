# Prerendering Fix Plan

## Issues Identified:
1. Browser-specific code (Google Maps, socket.io) being executed during SSR
2. No platform checks for browser-only APIs
3. Potential issues with map components during prerendering

## Files Modified:
- [x] src/app/pages/livreur/livreur-map/livreur-map.component.ts
- [x] src/app/components/tracking-map/tracking-map.component.ts
- [x] src/app/services/tracking.service.ts

## Changes Made:
1. **LivreurMapComponent**: Added platform detection using isPlatformBrowser
2. **TrackingMapComponent**: Added *ngIf="isBrowser" to prevent Google Maps from rendering during SSR
3. **TrackingService**: Added platform checks to all socket.io methods to prevent initialization and usage during SSR

## Next Steps:
- Test the prerendering by running the build command
- Verify that the '/livreur/map' route no longer causes worker thread termination errors

## Status:
âœ… All planned fixes have been implemented
